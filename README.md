# Test Activate Events

App is installed in every location and outputs to browser's debug Console window when event happens.

Filter on 'DEBUG' in Console window to reduce noise level and better see events as they happen.

All locations should have an app.activated event appear in the Console window.

top_bar, nav_bar, and ticket_editor locations should have pane.activated and pane.deactivated events appear.
